  <h1>Languages in the World</h1>
  <h2> by Lyu Xinyue Ada</h2>


  <h3> Introduction </h3>
  <p1>Despite we all know there are numerous languages spoken around the world, we probably donâ€™t have any idea about where they are spoken and where they originated from. The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) has been created by a team of 55 authors from DensityDesign to give people a visualized explanation.</p1>

   <ul style="list-style-type:disc">The dots are placed where the language is spoken and the languages are divided into 10 families represented by ten colors. Once click the names of language families, corresponding colors will occur on the dots.<li>It's highly interactive and people won't bother to search for where the regions are while reasing. What's more, the data is huge, which can't be presented in words and to condense it in such a visualized way made it so easy to understand and much more intuitive than if you were simply reading it from a journal, magazine or book. </li>
    <li> However simply by this picture, it's hard for prople to tell exactly how many people are speaking a certain language or just to compare the quantites of users of some languages. Thus, it needs other pictures to further complete it, and the team did do that. </li>
    </ul>
